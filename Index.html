        <h2>Key Teachings of the Bhagavad Gita</h2>
        <ul>
            <li id="dharma"><strong>Dharma (Righteous Duty):</strong> The Gita emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's duty without attachment to personal gain. By following our unique dharma, or righteous duty, we contribute to the well-being of society and progress on the spiritual path.</li>
            <li id="bhakti"><strong>Bhakti Yoga (Path of Devotion):</strong> Bhakti Yoga encourages us to surrender to the Divine and to cultivate a heart full of love, humility, and gratitude. Through devotion and trust, we develop a deeper connection with the Divine, which helps transcend ego and selfish desires.</li>
            <li id="karma"><strong>Karma Yoga (Selfless Action):</strong> Karma Yoga teaches us to perform actions selflessly, without attachment to outcomes. By dedicating our actions to the greater good and offering the results to a higher power, we purify our minds and reduce the impact of ego.</li>
            <li id="jnana"><strong>Jnana Yoga (Path of Knowledge):</strong> The path of Jnana Yoga focuses on gaining wisdom and understanding the nature of the self and the universe. By seeking knowledge and truth, we can transcend ignorance and realize the unity of all creation.</li>
            <li id="ego"><strong>Transcending the Ego:</strong> The Gita teaches that true spiritual growth requires us to rise above ego-driven desires and attachments. By cultivating detachment, we can experience a state of inner peace and equanimity, unaffected by the ups and downs of life.</li>
            <li id="equanimity"><strong>Equanimity (Samatva):</strong> The Gita encourages maintaining calmness and balance in both success and failure. This state of equanimity allows us to respond to life's challenges with clarity and wisdom, rather than being swayed by emotional highs and lows.</li>
            <li id="faith"><strong>Faith and Surrender:</strong> The Gita underscores the importance of having faith in the Divine and surrendering to its will. This surrender does not imply passivity, but rather a trust in the process of life, which allows us to act with purpose and peace of mind.</li>
        </ul>
